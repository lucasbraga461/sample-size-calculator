# Sample Size Calculator

This repository contains the code used to create the **Sample Size Calculator** application, accessible here:

👉 [**CALCULATOR CLICK HERE**](http://18.231.252.63:8080/)  

Built in **Python**, this calculator is deployed on **Google Cloud Run** (serverless) using a **Docker container** and **Streamlit**.

---

## Overview

The Sample Size Calculator addresses common scenarios for AB testing and statistical analyses, such as:
- Comparing two means
- Comparing two proportions
- Estimating a single mean
- Estimating a single proportion

The underlying mathematical formulas for these calculations are clearly documented here:

🧮 [**Sample Size Formulas**](./docs/README.md)

Additionally, you can review the Python implementation of these formulas in:

🐍 [`streamlit_sample_size_calculator.py`](./streamlit_sample_size_calculator.py)

For full details and insights on sample size calculations, see the comprehensive documentation in the Towards Data Science article:

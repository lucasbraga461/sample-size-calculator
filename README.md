# Sample Size Calculator
This repository contains the code that I used to create the sample size calculator available at: 
* [CALCULATOR CLICK HERE!](https://samplesizecalc-111395551744.us-west2.run.app/)  
written in Python and deployed in Google Cloud Run (serverless environment) using Docker container and Streamlit

The Sample Size Calculator was designed to address sample sizing for AB testing, but also for other purposes. See full documentation on the towardsdatascience article:
